# timeChecker
Works out if it's the users first time running the application/program.

# How it works
It's pretty simple - When you first open/run the application it generates a folder and places a file into it, then the next time the code/program runs, it will search for the file, if it's not there, It will identify as a first launch, however if it exists, the program will identify it exists and notice that it is clearly not their first time running the program.

# Current Version
This is the first and last release of this program, I wanted to get something on my github page, and I thought this simple python code would help new developers.
